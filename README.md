# schoolresources

React SPA that allows users to upload resources (textbooks, youtube videos, images, documents, etc.) for a specific class at a specific university.

The goal of this application is to reduce the amount of random googling people have to do when searching for help on a certain project/assignment.
Searching normally can be vague and ambiguous, but using a centralized list curated by students who have taken the exact same class from the
same professor could be very useful in reducing friction when learning a new concept or studying for an exam.
